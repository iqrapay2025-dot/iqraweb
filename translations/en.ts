      "IqraPay was born from a simple observation: Muslims around the world want to deepen their knowledge of Islam, but many face financial barriers to dedicating time to learning.",
    journeyPara2:
      "We asked ourselves: What if we could create a platform that rewards the noble pursuit of Islamic knowledge? What if learning the Qur'an and Sunnah could also provide halal sustenance?",
    journeyPara3:
      "That question led to IqraPay — a revolutionary platform that combines faith-based education with ethical, transparent earning opportunities. We've built this with scholars, educators, and fintech experts to ensure everything aligns with Islamic principles.",

    founderRole: "Founder & CEO",
    founderBio:
      "IqraPay was founded by Muhammad Jumah, a visionary student and entrepreneur committed to bridging the gap between faith, education, and technology. As a Linguistics student at the University of Ilorin, he continues to observe the challenges many Muslims face in balancing the pursuit of knowledge with financial stability. These ongoing experiences have inspired him to reflect deeply on how learning, faith, and livelihood can coexist harmoniously. Driven by a desire to make learning both rewarding and sustainable, he established IqraPay — a halal “Read-to-Earn” platform designed to empower Muslims to grow spiritually and financially through meaningful learning.",
    founderQuote:
      '"Knowledge without action is pointless, and action without halal sustenance is unsustainable. IqraPay bridges all three."',
    founderMessage:
      "As-salamu alaykum! IqraPay was born from a simple yet powerful vision: to make Islamic knowledge accessible while providing halal earning opportunities for Muslims worldwide. In a world filled with distractions, we wanted to create a platform that incentivizes what matters most - our connection with Allah through His Book. Alhamdulillah, what started as a dream has grown into a thriving community of thousands of learners across the globe. Join us in this blessed journey!",
